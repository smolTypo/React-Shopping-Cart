# Shopping cart application in React and Strapi

This is an exercise as part of Module 19 of MIT xPro Full Stack Bootcamp

The goal of this exercise is to implement a restocking feature for a React shopping cart application-- React is used to create the user interface and manage the state of the shopping cart application. Strapi is used to store the back-end data, such as the list of available products. When the user clicks the “ReStock Products” button, a call is made to the Strapi back end, and the response is used to update the shopping cart with the new products.
